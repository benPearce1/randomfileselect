randomfileselect
=========

**randomfileselect** will copy or touch random selections of files from source directories and place them in an output directory.

*Usage:*
```
  python randomfileselct.py -i randomfile-sample.cfg
```

If no input file is provided using the *-i* parameter, the script will look for *randomfile.cfg*.

A sample configuration file is provided in *randomfile-sample.cfg*
